# Meme-Archive
Here we compile and collect the dankest memes. No normies allowed. REEEEEE!!

Standards:

Any dank meme must have the source website and date it was discovered included in the name. 
For example, a meme from reddit discovered on 7/7/2017 would be: reddit-7-7-2017, using day/month/year.

We will then sort each meme by the month it was discovered, and the type of meme.

Review proccess:

In order to maintain quality, all memes must *NOT* be commited directly to Master. Instead, upload it to
a seperate branch, and allow over members to review it, and remove normie contamination.
