# Meme-Archive
Here we compile and collect the dankest memes. No normies allowed. REEEEEE!!

Standards:

Any dank meme must have the source website and date it was discovered included in the name. 
For example, a meme from reddit discovered on 7/7/2017 would be: reddit-7-7-2017, using day/month/year.

We will then sort each meme by the month it was discovered, and the type of meme.
